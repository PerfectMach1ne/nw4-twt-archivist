  # sed is a little weird thing. the syntax is `s/whattoreplace/withwhat/`, so you it is barely readable when we
  # have to use it to replace slashes with different slashes
  where_is_node=$(echo "/mnt/$where_is_node" | sed 's/\\/\//g' | sed 's/://' | sed 's/\/\//\//g' | sed 's/C/c/')
  # tl;dr
  # First sed does the slash substitution job, just poorly (replaces \\s with //s')
  # Second sed yeets the : from the C:
  # Third sed cleans up after the first - after s/, \/\/ mean "substitute //", after which you got the "/"
  #  separator for the command and a "\/", which is finally telling this cursed command to replace //s with a /
  #  Then we slap a /g to make it do this to every instance of // that it finds. Hey, as long as it works.
  # ... fourth sed added because apparently bash HATES that C is C and not c...
