# nw4-twt-archivist
For managing my Twitter Minecraft screenshot archive without overpriced Twitter API.

Web scraping code inspired by this:

- https://github.com/face-hh/tweetfree
- ["I Made Twitter API Free"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz8-puGf2nY)

## [Technical details here]

[todoooooo]
[let's go get this scraped data lesbians]

### Things I had to install to make this work

**puppeteer** (in project dir)

```npm install puppeteer```

**http-server** (in screenshot folder dir)

```npm install http-server```

Global install alternative:

```npm install http-server -g```

(although my silly Bash script is supposed to take care of those dependencies. Just install **Node.js, npm and WSL** and this stitched abomination from Betweenworlds should become runnable on your Windows system; since this is a comically unportable tool designed exclusively for personal use on my personal device, I'll think about how to make it runnable on penguin system when I gather up the courage to install it on my laptop ~~(grub on my old laptop with Windows & Linux deleted itself one day and I've been terrified of Windows Boot Loader since)~~) 

## Obligatory (m)Elon seasoning for the roast season

**"musk"**

*[m åsk]*

1. a strong-smelling reddish-brown substance which is secreted by the male musk deer for scent-marking and is an important ingredient in perfumery.

2. a relative of the monkey flower, formerly cultivated for a musky fragrance which has been lost in the development of modern varieties.
